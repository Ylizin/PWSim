      "The Apache Mesos API is designed to accommodate wide varieties of framework languages that developers use in the development of applications. The RPC-based API expands the language scope of driver-based framework APIs and simplifies the development protocols of REST-based HTTP APIs. The other interesting functionality of the API is that it has eliminated the need of opening connections back to client-side servers as a requirement for communicating with it. This has effectively opened it up its Mesos codebase to easy implementation of tremendous strategies for processing network partitions. Developers can also deploy the new HTTP functionality of the Apache Mesos API on experimental basis when streaming events. The API is a full release that is well documented. It sends requests in URI Query String/CRUD format and returns JSON-formatted responses.\n",
